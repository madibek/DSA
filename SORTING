1. Bubble sort
  bubble(list) 
  pre: list != null
  post: list has been sorted ascending order
  complexity: O(n^2)
  
  for i = 0 to list.count - 1
    for j = 0 to list.count - i -1
      if (list[i] < list[j]
        swap(list, i, j)
  
  return list
  
2. Merge sort
  mergeSort(list)
  pre: list != null
  post: list has been sorted in ascending order
  comlexity: O(n*log n)
  
  middle = list.count / 2
  
  for i = 0 to middle
    leftList[i] = list[i]
    
  for i = 0 to list.count - middle
    rightList[i] = list[middle + i]
    
  leftList = mergeSort(leftList)
  rightList = mergeSort(rightList)
  
  return mergeOrdered(leftList, rightList)
  
  ====================
  mergeOrdered(list1, list2)
  pre: list1 and list2 are not null
  post: return list merged with list1 and list2, which ordered in ascending order
  
  newlist
  for i = 0 to list1.count
    newList[i] = list1[i]
  
  for i = 0 to list2.count
    newList[list1.count + 1] = list2[i]
    
  return newList
